# Real Time Strategy Bot
This is a bot for the real time strategy game Clash Royale that can win games against new players. It uses sikulix(http://sikulix.com/) to automate clicking and image recognition, and BlueStacks to emulate the mobile game. The program recognizes what options (cards) there are and assesses the enviroment (how many of the opponent's towers are active) to decide where and with what to attack. Currently, the largest issue with the bot is its slow and sometimes innacurate image recognition, so implementing a more efficient image recognition function is the next step.
